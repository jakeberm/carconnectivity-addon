## Introduction

`CarConnectivity-Addon` allows you to connect and retrieve information about your vehicle from compatible manufacturers' online services. This guide explains how to properly configure the module.
I am simply packaging [the work (excellent) done by Till.](https://github.com/tillsteinbach/CarConnectivity)

His work is also available as docker images. So if you're using `Home Assistant` as a stand-alone `docker`, you can directly use it too.

**⚠️The project is still under development, `reverse engineering` of the api to be completed and communication with MQTT/Home assistant to be adapted.⚠️**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### 🚧 VAG API lockdown : Volkswagen / Seat / Cupra (May 2026)
>
> Since late May 2026, the Volkswagen Group has restricted third-party API access. The regular VW/Seat/Cupra connectors return `403` errors and no longer retrieve data, even though the official apps still work. There is currently no fix for these connectors.
>
> **Workaround:** the read-only `EU Data Act` connector is **✅ integrated in this add-on** (see the dedicated section below); blocked configurations are migrated to it automatically.

> [!TIP]
> ### An Edge version is available
> The **Edge** version is the **development build** (a work in progress, not a release): it ships the newest features first and can be unstable. Install **"CarConnectivity Add-on Edge"** from the same repository.

## Add repository

[![`Addon Home Assistant`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pulpyyyy/carconnectivity-addon/refs/heads/main/.github/img/addon-ha.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FPulpyyyy%2Fcarconnectivity-addon)


![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pulpyyyy/carconnectivity-addon/refs/heads/main/img/mqtt_device.png)

## Configuration

The add-on is configured entirely from its **built-in configuration page**, not from the Home Assistant options tab (which only shows a pointer to it).

**How to open it:** add-on **Info** tab → **OPEN WEB UI** button → **Configuration** button in the top bar of the page. When the web dashboard is disabled (or not started yet), the Web UI opens straight on the configuration page.

On first open, an existing configuration is **imported automatically** (including one produced by an older version of the add-on), and blocked Seat / Cupra / Volkswagen (Europe) connectors are **migrated automatically** to the EU Data Act connector at startup. After saving, **restart the add-on** to apply the new configuration.

### 1. Vehicles

Click **"+ Add vehicle"** and pick your brand; add one card per account. Supported brands:
- `Audi`
- `Bentley` *(EU Data Act only)*
- `Cupra` *(EU Data Act only: the manufacturer connector is blocked since May 2026)*
- `Renault / Dacia`
- `SEAT` *(EU Data Act only: the manufacturer connector is blocked since May 2026)*
- `Škoda`
- `Tronity`
- `Volkswagen (Europe)` *(EU Data Act only: the manufacturer connector is blocked since May 2026)*
- `Volkswagen (North America)` *(country automatically set from your Home Assistant country setting: `us` by default, `ca` if your HA is configured for Canada)*
- `Volvo`

The right **data source** is chosen for you. A choice only appears when more than one works (Škoda and Audi can use either their manufacturer account or the read-only EU Data Act portal; `Automatic` prefers the manufacturer one).

⚠️ You can add several vehicles, from different brands or two cars of the same brand that are not linked to the same account.

### 2. Connecting to the Manufacturer’s Online Services

The fields shown on each vehicle card depend on the brand:

For the VAG brands (`Volkswagen`, `SEAT`, `Cupra`, `Škoda`, `Audi`, `Bentley`, `Volkswagen North America`):
- `Username`: The email address used to log into the manufacturer’s service.
- `Password`: The password for your manufacturer account.
- `S-PIN` *(optional)*: The 4-digit code required for remote access to certain vehicle features.
- `VIN` *(optional)*: Restrict the account to one vehicle.

For `Volvo`:
- `API key (primary)` / `API key (secondary)`: Volvo API keys.
- `Vehicle token`: Access token for the vehicle.
- `Location token` *(optional)*: Access token for the location endpoint.
- `Interval` *(optional, seconds)*: Refresh interval. ⚠️ Too frequent refreshes may exceed the manufacturer's API request limits and trigger temporary restrictions.

For `Renault / Dacia`:
- `Username` / `Password`: Your My Renault account credentials.
- `Locale` *(optional)*: e.g. `fr_FR`, `de_DE`.
- `VIN` *(optional)*: Restrict the account to one vehicle.

For `Tronity`:
- `Client ID` / `Client secret`: Your Tronity API credentials.
- `Interval` *(optional, seconds)*: Refresh interval.
- `VIN` *(optional)*: Restrict the account to one vehicle.

#### The `EU Data Act` data source (Seat, Cupra, Volkswagen Europe, Bentley; optional for Škoda and Audi)

When a vehicle uses the EU Data Act data source, only two fields matter:
- `Username`: the email of your brand account (Volkswagen ID, SEAT, Cupra, etc.).
- `Password`: the password of that same brand account.

This **read-only** connector replaces the Seat / Cupra / Volkswagen (Europe) connectors that have been blocked (`403`) since May 2026. It refreshes data about every 15 minutes and **cannot send remote commands, location or vehicle images** (a warning in the top bar reminds you of this whenever it is in use). The brand, refresh interval and OIDC locale (country/language) are set automatically: you only provide your credentials.

> ⚠️ **Mandatory setup, do this first or it will not work.** This connector only *downloads* the datasets that the EU Data Act portal produces; it never creates them for you. If you skip this step the add-on connects but **receives no data**, which can look exactly like your credentials are being rejected. You must register on the portal and enable a permanent data delivery once:
>
> 1. Open **[eu-data-act.drivesomethinggreater.com](https://eu-data-act.drivesomethinggreater.com/)** and click **Log in**. Choose your brand (Volkswagen, SEAT, Cupra, ...) and sign in with the **same account** you use in the official brand app.
> 2. Select your vehicle and authorize **My Data Portal** to access it.
> 3. Click **Request customised data** (also shown as *Get customised data*) and configure:
>    - **all data clusters**,
>    - an **interval of 15 minutes**,
>    - an **unlimited / continuous** duration (no end date),
>    - a name of your choice (for example `All data 15min`).
> 4. Submit, then **be patient**. The first datasets can take **several hours, sometimes more than 24 hours**, to appear. After that a new ZIP file is published roughly every 15 minutes and the add-on picks it up automatically.
>
> You can check progress anytime by logging back into the portal and looking at the vehicle's data delivery list. As long as no continuous request is active and producing files, the connector has nothing to read.

Full details and limitations: [CarConnectivity-connector-vw-eu-data-act](https://github.com/mikrohard/CarConnectivity-connector-vw-eu-data-act).

### 3. MQTT Configuration (Mandatory)
`MQTT` is how vehicle data reaches `Home Assistant`:
- `Broker host`: IP or domain name of the MQTT server (leave blank for the Home Assistant Mosquitto add-on default, `core-mosquitto`)
- `Port`: broker port (default `1883`)
- `Username` / `Password`: MQTT broker credentials

⚠️ If you're not already using MQTT on `Home Assistant`, you can add, for example, [`Mosquitto Addon` and the `MQTT integration`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt)

### 4. Web dashboard
The original `CarConnectivity` dashboard can be enabled with the **"Enable the CarConnectivity web dashboard"** toggle. Once the add-on restarts, the Web UI opens on the dashboard, and the top bar lets you switch between **Dashboard** and **Configuration** at any time.

- `Login user` / `Login password` *(optional)*: leave the user empty (or `autologin`) to be logged in automatically; set both to require a login.

### 5. Logging Level
Define the amount of information recorded in logs:
- `Info`: Displays general operational information.
- `Warning`: Displays only warnings.
- `Error`: Displays only error messages.
- `Debug`: Displays additional details useful for troubleshooting.

### 6. API Logging Level
Define the amount of information recorded in logs:
- `Info`: Displays general operational information.
- `Warning`: Displays only warnings.
- `Error`: Displays only error messages.
- `Debug`: Displays additional details useful for troubleshooting.

#### Per-component levels (advanced)

The two levels above apply globally. To troubleshoot a single component without flooding the log, expand **"Per-component levels (advanced)"** in the Logging section of the configuration page: each configured vehicle account (log + API level) and each plugin (MQTT, Web dashboard, ABRP, MQTT Home Assistant) gets its own selector. `default` inherits the global level, so you can for example keep everything at `info` and set only the MQTT plugin to `debug`. A badge on the collapsed line shows how many overrides are active.

Note: a `debug` override on a **vehicle account** also makes the shared HTTP libraries verbose for the whole add-on; plugin overrides are fully isolated.

### 7. `ABRP - A Better Routeplanner`

Enable **"Send data to ABRP"**, then add one row per vehicle with **"+ Add ABRP token"**:

- `VIN`: the **Vehicle Identification Number** (17 alphanumeric characters), unique to each vehicle.
- `ABRP token`: the **authentication token** generated by ABRP for that vehicle.

#### Prerequisites

To retrieve your token, go to your vehicle on A Better Routeplanner, select "Live Data," and then link your vehicle using the "Generic" section. The token to paste into the configuration will be displayed. Add a VIN/token row for each vehicle you wish to connect to ABRP.

### 8. Expert Mode
Expert Mode enables the use of all native Carconnectivity functions, including those not available through the graphical interface, as long as the corresponding functions are supported by the add-on binaries.

⚠️ Warning:
This mode disables all content validation and safety checks. As a result, even a small mistake (such as an invalid JSON syntax) can prevent the add-on from launching correctly.

Expert Mode is intended for advanced users only.
To use it safely, you must:

Be familiar with JSON syntax and structure.

Expert Mode is activated simply by the **presence** of a `/addon_configs/1b1291d4_carconnectivity-addon/carconnectivity.expert.json` file containing the desired settings (no option to toggle). It takes precedence and completely replaces the configuration produced by the configuration page, which is written to `/addon_configs/1b1291d4_carconnectivity-addon/carconnectivity.json` (the page's editable model is saved separately in `carconnectivity.configui.json`). The directory `/addon_configs/1b1291d4_carconnectivity-addon/` may not appear right away in the `Home Assistant` file system. If this is the case, restart the supervisor.

Refer to the official Carconnectivity documentation for the list of supported functions and expected parameters.

## Best Practices
- **Only add vehicle cards for the accounts you own.**
- **Do not share your login credentials.**
- **Adjust the refresh interval (where available) to avoid exceeding API request limits. Remember the limit seems to be about 1000 req/day.**
- **Use the "Debug" logging level only when troubleshooting issues, and prefer a per-component override to keep the rest of the log quiet.**
- **Restart the add-on after saving the configuration.**
